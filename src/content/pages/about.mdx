Hi there, I'm Chris. I'm a designer, full stack developer, [writer](/articles), father and husband.

I work at [Careguide](https://careguide.com), where I am the lead engineer, 
leading a team of 8 developers and 2 designers, helping care providers connect
with families to bring care to the world.

### Background

I've been working in tech since 2013. I started my career as a designer, graduating with an
associates diploma in interdiscplinary design.

I spent two years working in marketing as a brand designer. Then I spent two years as a product designer
working exclusively on mobile apps. After that I spent roughly two years running my own business offering branding,
search engine optimization, and inbound marketing services, which I then closed shop on and handed off
all of my clients.

I've spent the last four years working as a fullstack developer. I've gotten to work as a team lead,
technical project manager, and scrum master (for better or for worse).
